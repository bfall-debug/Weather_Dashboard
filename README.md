## Note of Bug: clicking on the search history will not load data unless you first refresh the page. This will allow you to click on the search history to load it of the ones that we're refreshed. However new searches will also not work until the page is refreshed again.

Program works by typing a city into the search bar and clicking the search button to get the current weather data along with the 5 day forecast for that city.

Each search has its search history saved below the search bar which can then be clicked to reload that cities data.

## API's
